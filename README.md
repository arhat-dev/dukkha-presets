## Convensions

### Image Flavor

- `native` (alias of alpine-native)
- `alpine-native`
  - default, use same arch image as host arch, no cross gcc toolchain, alpine based
- `debian-navive`
  - same as alpine-native, but based on debian

- `cross` (alias of alpine-cross)
- `alpine-cross`
  - use same arch image as host arch, with cross gcc, alpine based, when `matrix.arch` is not supported by alpine, switch to debian based image automatically.
  - if no cross toolchain for host_arch, switch to qemu mode automatically
- `debian-cross` (same as alpine-cross, but debian based)

- `qemu` (alias of alpine-qemu)
- `alpine-qemu`
  - use target `matrix.arch` image, should have qemu-static configured in host, when `matrix.arch` is not supported by alpine, switch to debian based image automatically.
- `debian-qemu` (same as alpine-qemu, but debian based)
